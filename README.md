Introduction

CNNs are a class of deep neural networks that are particularly effective for image classification tasks. This project involves:

Building a CNN from scratch.

Training the model on a labeled dataset.

Testing and evaluating its performance.

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cnn-project.git
cd cnn-project


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Make sure you have installed TensorFlow or PyTorch depending on your choice for the deep learning framework.



Dataset

The dataset used for this project is CIFAR-10, which contains 60,000 images across 10 classes. Alternatively, you can use any custom image dataset by modifying the data loading pipeline.

To download the dataset, follow the instructions in the src/data_loader.py file.

Training the Model

1. To train the CNN model:

python src/train.py --epochs 20 --batch-size 64 --dataset-path ./dataset


2. Hyperparameters like the number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, etc., can be configured through command-line arguments.


3. The trained model will be saved in the models/ directory.



Results

Once the training is complete, the model's accuracy and loss during training and validation will be logged. You can visualize these metrics by running the following command:

python src/plot_metrics.py

Sample results:

Training accuracy: 92%

Validation accuracy: 89%

Confusion matrix for the test set.


Usage

1. After training, you can use the model to predict new images:

python src/predict.py --image-path /path/to/image.jpg --model-path ./models/cnn_model.pth


2. The predict.py script takes an image as input and outputs the predicted label.
